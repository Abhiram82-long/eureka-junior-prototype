### 3. Methodology Page (methodology.html)
- **Transparent explanation** of recommendation process
- **4-step process breakdown**:
  1. Requirement Analysis
  2. Intelligent Search & Matching
  3. Ranking & Scoring
  4. Evidence-Based Recommendations

- **Intelligent matching** based on multiple criteria
- **Structured JSON responses** for consistent formatting

### 5. Caching & Offline Capabilities
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** ready for installation on supported devices for an app-like experience.
- **Service Worker** for basic offline support, allowing access to cached pages.
- **Session-based caching** for API responses to prevent redundant calls during a single session.

## üìç Functional Entry Points

### Main Pages:
- `/index.html` - Homepage with search functionality
- `/results.html` - Displays AI-generated recommendations
- `/methodology.html` - Explains the recommendation approach

### API Integration:
- **Gemini API Endpoint**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:generateContent`
- **API Key**: Provided by the user at runtime. The key is stored in `sessionStorage` for the duration of the session and is not persisted.

### JavaScript Modules:
- `/js/main.js` - Handles search form, API calls, and navigation
- `/js/results.js` - Manages results display and export functionality

## üîÆ Future Development Roadmap

The following features are planned for future versions to enhance the platform:

1. **User Accounts**: To save search history, manage favorites across devices, and set preferences.
2. **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Allow users to sort results by confidence, price, or other criteria, and apply advanced filters.
3. **Enhanced Offline Mode**: Improve the service worker to cache API results, enabling full offline access to previous searches.
4. **Feedback & Rating System**: Allow users to rate the quality of recommendations to fine-tune the AI model.
5. **Human Expert Validation**: Introduce an optional "expert review" for high-stakes or enterprise-level queries.
6. **Sandboxed Benchmarks**: For certain software categories, provide performance benchmarks in a sandboxed environment.
7. **Enterprise & Procurement Support**: Features tailored for business users, including team collaboration and procurement workflows.
8. **Affiliate/Referral Integration**: To support the platform's development and offer users potential discounts.

## üí° Recommended Next Steps

1. **Enhance Comparison Tool**:
   - Allow comparison of more than 3 tools.
   - Add more detailed comparison metrics and visualizations.

2. **Improve Error Handling & Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
   - Add retry logic for failed API requests, potentially using the service worker's background sync capabilities.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement a more robust caching strategy for API results beyond the current session-based approach.
   - Further optimize assets and rendering for faster load times.

4. **Analytics & User Feedback**:
   - Integrate a privacy-respecting analytics tool to understand user behavior and improve the service.
   - Implement a simple feedback mechanism on the results page.

5. **Mobile & Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Conduct thorough testing on various mobile devices to refine the user experience.
   - Improve accessibility by ensuring compliance with WCAG standards.
