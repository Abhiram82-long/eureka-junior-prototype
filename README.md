## üìç Functional Entry Points

### Main Pages:
- `/index.html` - Homepage with search functionality
- `/results.html` - Displays AI-generated recommendations
- `/methodology.html` - Explains the recommendation approach

### API Integration:
- **Gemini API Endpoint**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:generateContent`
- **API Key**: Provided by the user at runtime. The key is stored in `sessionStorage` for the duration of the session and is not persisted.

### JavaScript Modules:
- `/js/main.js` - Handles search form, API calls, and navigation
- `/js/results.js` - Manages results display and export functionality

## üîÆ Features Not Yet Implemented

These features are planned for future development:

1. **User accounts and saved searches**
2. **Comparison tool** for side-by-side analysis
3. **Human expert validation** for high-value queries
4. **Sandboxed benchmarks** for performance testing
5. **Enterprise procurement support**
6. **Affiliate/referral integration**
7. **Advanced filtering and sorting** on results page
8. **Feedback and rating system** for recommendations
9. **API rate limiting and error handling improvements**
10. **Offline mode with cached recommendations**

## üí° Recommended Next Steps

1. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add retry logic for API failures.
   - Implement graceful degradation for cases where the API is unavailable.

2. **Improve Performance**:
   - Further optimize API calls by reducing payload size or complexity.
   - Investigate options for pre-warming or caching common query results on a backend layer.

3. **Add Analytics**:
   - Track search patterns
   - Monitor recommendation accuracy
   - Collect user feedback

4. **Expand Database**:
   - Build knowledge graph of tools
   - Add more categories and use cases
   - Include user reviews and ratings

5. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Create mobile-specific layouts
   - Add touch gestures
   - Optimize for slower connections
